# Simple Camel Spring Boot Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Apache Camel with a Spring Boot application to process CSV files. It focuses on testing Camel routes using JUnit 5, with an emphasis on mocking endpoints to simulate and verify file processing without relying on actual file systems.

## Key Features

- **Apache Camel Integration**: Utilizes Apache Camel for routing and mediation rules.
- **Spring Boot**: Leverages the simplicity and power of Spring Boot for easy setup and configuration.
- **JUnit 5 Testing**: Implements robust testing using JUnit 5 to ensure the accuracy and reliability of Camel routes.
- **Mocking Endpoints**: Demonstrates how to use `mock` endpoints to test Camel routes in isolation.
- **CSV File Processing**: Processes CSV files and verifies the correct transformation and routing of data.
